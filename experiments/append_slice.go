	/* Explanations:
	-- First case ('b' is a copy of 'a'):
	Upon creation, the length and capacity of 'a' are equal.
	Therefore, when appending a new element, the slice is copied into a new one whose capacity is the double (10 vs 5).
	Since 'b' is a new slice, modifying one of its elements does not change the content of 'a'.


	-- Second case ('c' is a reference to 'b'):
	The length of 'b' is smaller than its capacity.
	Therefore, when appending a new element, the original slice ('b') is mutated directly to add the extra element.
	Since 'c' is a reference to 'b', modifying one element also modifies the same element in 'b'.

	If 'c' is a reference to 'b', why does 'b' show only 6 elements and not 7 like 'c' ?
	Because a slice stores a pointer to the array where the elements are stored AND the length (i.e. the number of
	elements the slice contains) (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39993688/are-slices-passed-by-value).
	Somehow, a slice is thus a view of its underlying array, from the first item to item nÂº length_slice.
